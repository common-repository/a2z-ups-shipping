Useful filters:

1) Customs Rates

>function ups_shipping_cost_conversion($ship_cost, $pack_weight = 0, $to_country = "", $rate_code = ""){
>    $sample_flat_rates = array("GB"=>array( //Use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 as country code
>								"weight_from" => 10,
>								"weight_upto" => 30,
>								"rate" => 2000,
>								"rate_code" => "ups_12", //You can add UPS service type and use it based on your's need. Get this from our plugin's configuration (services tab).
>							),
>								"US"=>array(
>								"weight_from" => 1,
>								"weight_upto" => 30,
>								"rate" => 5000,
>								),
>							);
>
>		if(!empty($to_country) && !empty($sample_flat_rates)){
>			if(isset($sample_flat_rates[$to_country]) && ($pack_weight >= $sample_flat_rates[$to_country]['weight_from']) && ($pack_weight <= $sample_flat_rates[$to_country]['weight_upto'])){
>				$flat_rate = $sample_flat_rates[$to_country]['rate'];
>				return $flat_rate;
>			}else{
>				return $ship_cost;
>			}
>		}else{
>				return $ship_cost;
>		}
>
>    }
>    add_filter('hitstacks_ups_shipping_cost_conversion','ups_shipping_cost_conversion',10,4);

(Note: Flat rate filter example code will set flat rate for all UPS carriers. Have to add code to check and alter rate for specific carrier. While copy paste the code from worpress plugin page may throw error "Undefined constant". It can be fixed by replacing backtick (`) to apostrophe (') )

2) To Sort the rates from Lowest to Highest

> add_filter( 'woocommerce_package_rates' , 'hitshipo_sort_shipping_methods', 10, 2 );
> function hitshipo_sort_shipping_methods( $rates, $package ) {
>   if ( empty( $rates ) ) return;
>       if ( ! is_array( $rates ) ) return;
> uasort( $rates, function ( $a, $b ) { 
>   if ( $a == $b ) return 0;
>       return ( $a->cost < $b->cost ) ? -1 : 1; 
>  } );
>       return $rates;
> }
